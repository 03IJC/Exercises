# Description
Multiple different sorting algorithms


# SelectionSort
This sorting algorithm basically breaks an array into 2 parts, a sorted part and an unsorted part (It doesn't actually). 
To the left of the current element is sorted; the current element and what is to the right of it is unsorted.
Selection sort sorts by looking for the minimum (or maximum) in the unsorted part of the array then it swaps it with current element.
This algorithm has a Big-Oh of O(n^2) in all cases.
